# Psycomfy
The number of negative opinions about mental health has become an impetus for us to make breakthroughs and break down the negative opinions that are spread in the community about mental health. Mental health is an important thing in human life. Mental health changes can also be caused by the smallest and simplest things to lead to very significant changes. So we made an application as a form of effort and a forum for people who have minimal knowledge of mental health. This application is designed for those who feel disturbed by their mental health and can find out about their mental health condition through this application. So that itâ€™s easier for users because it can be used wherever and whenever they need it.
